## ðŸŒ² Random Forest (Bagging)

### Use when:

- You want better generalization than a single tree.

- The dataset has high variance or noise.

- You need feature importance insights.

### Pros:

- Reduces overfitting by averaging multiple trees.

- Handles missing values and categorical features well.

## âš¡ AdaBoost (Boosting)

### Use when:

- You want to focus on hard-to-classify examples.

- The data is clean and not too noisy.

- You need a lightweight boosting method.

### Cons:

- Sensitive to noisy data and outliers.

- Can overfit if not tuned properly.

## ðŸš€ Gradient Boosting

### Use when:

- You need high accuracy and are okay with longer training time.

- The dataset is complex and benefits from iterative error correction.

- You want to fine-tune performance with learning rate and depth.

### Pros:

- Often outperforms other models in competitions.

- Can be regularized to prevent overfitting.
