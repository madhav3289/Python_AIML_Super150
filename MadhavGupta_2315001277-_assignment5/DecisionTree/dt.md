## Decision Tree:- 

A Decision Tree is a popular supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works like a flowchart where:

- Each internal node represents a decision based on a feature.

- Each branch represents the outcome of that decision.

- Each leaf node represents a final prediction (class label or value).


### Pros:

- Easy to understand and visualize.

- No need for feature scaling.

- Handles both numerical and categorical data.

### Cons:

- Prone to overfitting.

- Unstable to small changes in data.

- Biased towards features with more levels.

### Use when:

- You want a simple, interpretable model.

- The dataset is small or has clear decision boundaries.

- You need fast training and prediction.

### Avoid if:

- The model overfits easily on noisy or complex data.
